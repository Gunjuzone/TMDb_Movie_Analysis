# TMDb_Movies

> This is a data analysis of TMDb movie data set. This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies (from 1966 to 2015) The data was collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). It includes user ratings and revenue. I am interested in the trend between ratings and revenue, and how much the revenue has changed over the years. I assume it will be possible to check how the budget and revenue has changed because the dataset has been adjusted for the inflation over time. This was probably done to reflect the value of budget from years ago to the recent time value.
